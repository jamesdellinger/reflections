What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git will be able to track changes made to new files created in the repository.
In order to make and track commits, a repository first needs to be
initialized.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is where I track the one or more files whose changes will be
part of my next single commit.
